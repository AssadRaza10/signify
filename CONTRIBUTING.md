# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving this project. A few guidelines to help contributions go smoothly:

- Please open an issue before starting major changes so the maintainers can provide guidance.
- Fork the repository, create a feature branch, and make pull requests against `main`.
- Keep changes small and focused. Add tests or notebooks where appropriate.
- Follow common Python style conventions (PEP8). We recommend using `black` and `isort`.

If you are submitting data or model files, please ensure you have the right to distribute them.
