License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by
the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public
License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a
license to create or exercise any rights under copyright and related rights that are
not owned or controlled by the Licensor, such as publicity or privacy rights,
this Public License does not grant You any such rights. You may not exercise any
Licensed Rights so as to violate applicable laws or regulations.

Section 1. Definitions.

a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is
derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is
translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes
of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or
sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
synched in timed relation with a moving image.

b. Adapters’ License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights
in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Public License.

c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related
to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording,
and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)
are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of
proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under
Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar
international agreements.

e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the
Licensed Material.

f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material
to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar
Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has
authority to license.

h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public
License.

i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires
permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public
performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make
material available online.

j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from
Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on
the legal protection of databases, as amended, extended, or replaced, as well as
other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public
License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2. Scope.

a. License grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable,
non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed
Material to:

	i. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

	ii. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

b. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and
Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need
to comply with its terms and conditions.

c. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

d. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to
exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives
and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making
technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
transcoding to different file formats or making other adaptations necessary to use
the Licensed Material with different software or hardware. For purposes of this
Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a) never
produces Adapted Material.

e. Downstream recipients.

	i. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed
	Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed
	Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

	ii. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or
	different terms or conditions on, or apply Effective Technological Measures to,
	the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any
	recipient of the Licensed Material.

Section 3. License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

a. Attribution. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You
must: (i) retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
Material: (A) identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any
others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the
Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); (B) a copyright notice; (C) a
notice that refers to this Public License; (D) a notice that refers to the disclaimer
of warranties; (E) a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent
reasonably practicable; and (ii) indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
retain an indication of any previous modifications. The information required by
paragraphs (i)(A)–(C) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided that in
the case of Adapted Material, at a minimum You must retain a credit identifying the
creator of the Licensed Material, a copyright notice, and a notice that refers to
this Public License.

b. No endorsement. You must not indicate that the Licensor endorses You or Your use
of the Licensed Material without the Licensor’s prior written permission.

Section 4. Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use
of the Licensed Material: If You Share the Licensed Material, or if You make the
Licensed Material available online, then both the Licensor and You waive any rights
and obligations under Sui Generis Database Rights that may require attribution of
source or impose other restrictions on reuse of the contents of the database. In
all other cases, to the extent that Sui Generis Database Rights apply to Your use of
the Licensed Material, the Licensor grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce,
and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

Section 5. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible,
the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and makes no representations or
warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied,
statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects,
accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable.

b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal
theory for any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other damages
arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

c. To the extent possible, the aggregate liability of the Licensor to You, whether
in contract, tort, or otherwise, will not exceed the greater of (i) the amount that You
paid the Licensor to use the Licensed Material (if any), or (ii) one hundred US dollars
(US$100.00). Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the
limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages; accordingly,
this limitation may not apply to You.

Section 6. Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed
herein. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under
this Public License terminate automatically.

b. Where Your rights under this Public License terminate due to Your non-compliance,
the Licensor may elect to offer You a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable
license to exercise some or all of the Licensed Rights for a specific purpose and
time. Such license, if offered, will be exclusive to You and will not be transferable.

c. The rights granted to You under this Public License will terminate automatically
upon termination of the license described in Section 6(b) if You breach the terms of
that license.

Section 7. Other Terms and Conditions.

a. Unless expressly stated otherwise, the Licensor shall not be bound by any additional
or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. No term or provision of this Public License will be interpreted to prohibit the
exercise of any rights that cannot be limited by contract under applicable law.

c. If any provision of this Public License is held to be unenforceable, it will be
replaced by an enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the
original provision and the remainder of this Public License will remain in force.

Section 8. Interpretation.

a. For the purposes of this Public License, where the context requires, the singular
will include the plural and vice versa; the term "including" is not limiting; and
headings are for reference only and do not affect interpretation.

THE LICENSED MATERIAL IS PROVIDED "AS-IS." YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. THE
LICENSOR GIVES NO WARRANTIES AND EXERCISES NO LIABILITY UNDER THIS PUBLIC LICENSE.
